      " Rattanakiri has long been occupied by many separate highland Khmer Loeu hill tribes; some of which has little contact with the rest of the world and still maintaining much of their own traditions. Overall, this frontier province is renowned for her unique natural beauty and wealth of natural resources. The physical and environmental characteristics form an impressive range of intriguing destinations for eco-tourism; they include undulating hills and mountains, a level plateau, watershed lowlands, clear crater lakes, rivers and beautiful waterfalls.

You can look out across to large trees on the opposite bank, watch the water cascades from a gentle pool at the top and drops down 10m to a larger pool below. From a distance, the scene resembles a brush Chinese painting on rice paper.",

      "The rock cavern of the waterfall provides shelter around the perimeter; few places offer such luxury. The Katieng is one of those less visited locations in the province, pretty much undisturbed and peaceful; a neat place to be at one with nature - to relax and be basked in total tranquility.",

      "Some people would combine their visit here with an elephant ride from the elephant village of Phume Kateung, a short distance north of the waterfalls. These rides are clocked at 90 minutes per time, so that wouldnâ€™t be a good option if yours is to come for the enjoyment of the beauty and tranquility at the Katieng Waterfall.",

On the surface, some stretches of water glitter like diamonds and emeralds with white sandy beaches running alongside attracting scores of tourists to sunbath and make merry. The clear water along the river reflects the colourful sky-backed mountains and jungle and even during the dry season, the ambience can be charming. The numerous stretches of beach boast many spots for swimming and fishing; such recreational activities attract both local and international tourists all year round.",

While the Chinese observe their own Chinese culture and traditional practices, the other groups also have their own ancestral practices to keep their identities. Here, they all communicate commonly in Chinese although all of them do speak Khmer and understood the Cambodian language well. The Hill Tribe, and people of Laotian ethnicity speak in their mother tongue among their own kind.",
