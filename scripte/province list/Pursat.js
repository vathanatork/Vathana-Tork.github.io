Skillful craftsmen can be seen at work sculpting huge Buddhas or beautiful statues. There are over 160 carving workshops in most districts, except the mountainous Veal Veng district. Most workshops are small private enterprises, although the odd one employs up to 13 craftsmen. Many workshops and shops in Pursat sell examples of the magnificent marble handiwork, which can make stylish souvenirs.",
